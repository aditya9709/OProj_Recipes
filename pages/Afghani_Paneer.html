    <h3>A Simple Afghani Paneer Recipe!</h3>
    <p>
      Paneer Afghani is known for its aromatic gravy that’s special in every way
      indeed. Afghani flavor is characteristically sweet and spicy at the same
      time. While it takes time to perfect that characteristic taste and flavor,
      the typical Afghani flavor for your own paneer Afghani can be achieved
      using the foods and ingredients available in your home.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>450 g Cottage cheese (paneer)</li>
      <li>1 medium onion — thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tsp ginger garlic paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup cashew nuts (kaju) — ground to a paste</li>
      <li>1/2 cup Melon (kharbooja) seeds — ground to a paste</li>
      <li>1 cup full cream milk (warm)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp cream</li>
      <li>1 large tomato - diced</li>
      <li>3 cloves (laung)</li>
      <li>1 small cardamom (elaichi)</li>
      <li>1 medium basil leaf (tejpatta)</li>
      <li>5 kishmish (dried grape)</li>
      <li>salt, sugar, pepper, red chili powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the cottage cheese into small cubes and lightly deep fry in
        hydrogenated oil. Do not over-fry the cottage cheese cubes, just sieve
        them out of oil when they lose that raw look.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1 tbsp of fresh olive oil into a pan. If you don’t have olive oil,
        then you may also use fresh sunflower oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil till it attains a temperature high enough for frying and
        add the onions and sauté in low-mid flame till golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ginger garlic paste, tomato, 1/2 tsp sugar, salt and ½ tsp pepper
        and cook till tomato turns pulpy. Add the cashew nut and melon seed
        paste and stir well. Let the mixture cool and blend in mixer with milk
        and cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the blended mixture in a pan and add the cottage cheese cubes and
        kishmish and boil/simmer for two minutes, check for saltiness (also for
        sweetness), and turn off the burner.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat one teaspoon of butter in a small frying pan, add cloves,
        cardamoms, and basil leaf with crackling sound and pour the spices with
        butter into the paneer mixture.
      </li>
    </ol>
