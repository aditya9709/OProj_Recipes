    <h3>A Delicious Recipe For Chicken Tikka</h3>
    <p>
      Tandoori Chicken Tikka (Murgh Tikka) is a popular North Indian starter,
      where boneless chicken pieces are coated with a spicy marinade and then
      grilled to perfection. This authentic snack recipe is great to make for
      parties or get-togethers. Use my simple recipe to make it in an oven,
      stovetop, air fryer, or outdoor grill.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        3 chicken breasts - (approx 500g/17.5 oz) - chopped into bite-size
        chunks
      </li>
      <li>120 g (½ cup) Greek yogurt - - or thick natural yogurt (full fat)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic - - peeled and minced</li>
      <li>1 tbsp minced ginger</li>
      <li>Juice of half a lemon</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>½ tsp cumin</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>½ tsp mild chilli powder</li>
      <li>1 pinch of cinnamon</li>
      <li>½ tsp salt</li>
      <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>
        2 tbsp vegetable oil - - for brushing onto the chicken before grilling
      </li>
      <li>2 tbsp freshly chopped coriander</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the chicken breast pieces into a bowl or freezer bag with the
        yogurt, garlic, ginger, lemon juice, coriander, turmeric, cumin,
        paprika, chilli powder, cinnamon, salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together so that everything is combined, then cover and place in the
        fridge to marinate for 2-3 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're using wooden skewers, place them in water to soak while the
        chicken is marinating.This will help to prevent them burning during
        grilling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge and thread onto skewers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the chicken with the oil, then place on a griddle plate and cook,
        turning a couple of times, for 8-10 minutes until cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternatively, you can grill (broil) under a grill, or you can barbecue
        for the same amount of time. Make sure the chicken is cooked by slicing
        into a larger piece and ensuring it's no longer pink in the middle.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with a sprinkling of freshly chopped coriander.</li>
    </ol>
